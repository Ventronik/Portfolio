# Ventronik Portfolio site
 ## Why
 - I wanted a portfolio site to showcase some of my projects
 - I wanted to make it entirely on my own because I haven't made a simple static site in a long time
 - I wanted to do it quick and cheap 

 ## Results
  - It was good to revisit native JS, especially the css elements
  - Overall it took me about 4 hours to make and deploy.
    - A lot of that time was making aesthetic decisions, looking for images and pleasing color combinations
  - Deployed at impossible-base.surge.sh

  ## Lessons learned
  - Surge is super easy to use
